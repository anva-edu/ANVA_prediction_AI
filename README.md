# Student Result Prediction System

This project is an AI-based system for predicting student results using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction modules.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and prototyping
- `src/`: Source code for the pipeline
- `models/`: Saved models
- `reports/`: Reports and visualizations
- `tests/`: Unit tests

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run notebooks in `notebooks/` for EDA and prototyping.
3. Use `main.py` to train or predict from the command line.

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for details.
